User interface guideline for run-path mapper:

1. Prompt user for a starting point (this step is mandatory):
		Take input string, search keys and place names using grep-style search
		(Search individual words vs whole phrase?)
		Prompt for confirm (if multiple matches, display matches, ask for KEY to confirm)
2. Prompt for destination (this is optional; provide way to indicate none):
		Do same confirmation for destination node
3. Prompt for distance:
		If destination is set, provide min. distance between points as minimum route distance.
				Allow user to cancel at this point
		Provide option to give desired distance (longer than min.)
		Validate distance input, repeat prompt if necessary (nonnegative, numeric, etc)
4. (Potentially allow user to choose different routes (similar to google maps))
5. Display route:
		Simple listing of nodes (i.e. start at fisher, then go to KC, then Basilica, then LaFun)
		Special Cases: non-landmark paths (e.g. path around lakes, etc)
